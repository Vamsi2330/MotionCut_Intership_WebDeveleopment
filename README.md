# User Registration Form Project

This project is part of a web development internship and serves as an exercise in creating a dynamic and visually appealing user registration form using HTML and CSS.

## Project Overview

The User Registration Form project aims to create a modern and interactive registration form for a website. The primary focus is on user experience, visual appeal, and responsiveness across various devices.

## Technologies Used

The project primarily utilizes HTML and CSS for form structure and styling. The form is designed with responsiveness in mind to ensure a seamless experience for users on desktop and mobile devices.

## Features

The registration form includes the following features:

- Username Field
- Email Field
- Password Field
- Submit Button
- Interactive design and moving elements with CSS animations
- Responsive design for a wide range of screen sizes

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following key files and folders:

- `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure for the user registration form.
- `style.css`: Includes the CSS styles for creating an interactive and visually engaging registration form.
- `README.md`: The file you are currently reading, providing an overview of the project.

## How to Use

To view the registration form, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. The form is designed to be responsive and visually engaging. Users can interact with the form fields and see the visual feedback provided by the CSS animations.

## Future Enhancements

In the future, the project could potentially integrate client-side form validation using JavaScript to improve the user experience and provide real-time feedback to users while filling out the form.
